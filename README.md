<h1 align="center">Gondi</h1>

Gondi is a rendition of the group game "Mafia" where there are 2 Gondis (Mafia members), one police officer, one accomplice, one detective, a doctor and the villagers

## Roles
**Gondi (x2)** - In the beginning of every round (the villagers asleep), they kill a villager each

**Doctor**- In the Sleep phase, they can save any player or themselves just not twice in a row. They also can't save someone already eliminated

**Detective**- In each sleep, they can inquire on the identity of one player. They can share the identity if they feel like (Can only be in the game if there is an accomplise)

**Accomplice** - Runs interference. They throw everyone off the real Gondi's trail (they don't know who the gondis are either) (Can only be in the game if there is a detective). They win if at least one gondi is left standing

**Villager**-  Votes on who the Gondis are after every sleep round

**Narrator/Moderator** - Moderates the game

- All Gondis are dead → Villagers win.

- Gondis equal or outnumber villagers → Gondis win.
