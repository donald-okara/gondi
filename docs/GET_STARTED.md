<h1 align="center">Getting started</h1>

Welcome, weary traveller. You’re here because you care about the code behind **Gondi**, and maybe you’re even thinking about forking it. I salute you — there’s a bit of work to do before you can run the app successfully.

Here are the docs you’ll want to check out first:

1. [Authentication](AUTHENTICATION.md)
2. [Supabase Queries](QUERIES.md)

Good luck, and may your builds be green.
